These smart contracts have been developed as part of
the [*Prenez Place !*](https://github.com/Prenez-Place/Face-B-Blockchain-module)
project, and are based on the [OpenSea creatures](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/opensea-creatures) repository.

While these NFTs exist as such and comply with the ERC-721 standard in their interface, they can never be owned. After
their creation, any purchase or transfer will
necessarily burn the token. This rule is written into the smart contract by allowing the transfer of a token only to an
address that no one controls. Thus, each token is burnt on the Blockchain as a last performative gesture of creation of
a Common.
